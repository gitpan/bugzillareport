bugzillareport 
===============================================

Bugzilla is a great bug tracking/development tool.

I often get asked by non tech people, how a project is coming along. 
Bugzilla long text format is *almost* human legible.  The short detail search is too vague.

This script creates output that is more concise, so you can show it to your coworkers- 
and it will make some sense.

Motivation

The module WWW::Bugzilla3 allows you to do some of this.  But it depends on Bugzillaâ€™s
xmlrpc.cgi transactions. Which seem not to support full text retrieval, with comments etc.

What bugzillareport does is make direct sql calls to the database itself.  So while this
works for Bugzilla3, it may not work retroactively or in the (not so far?) future.

Example Output

 The  various screens in the dms ap process were designed to be for use
 inhouse. The users were supposed to be able to approve, and disapprove
 invoices.
 The managers were to merge an approved invoice with a scanned check.

 We did not design view screens specifically for users in these various
 steps of the ap process.
 These various screens have to be designed.
